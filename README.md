## 🌟 Philosophy

**Our mission is to cultivate a strong, collaborative coding culture.**

### First-Principles Thinking
We believe in understanding concepts from the ground up. Our learning tracks build intuition, not just pattern recognition.

### Community-Driven  
Learning DSA is hard, and it's better together. KodeBloks features community events, leaderboards, and collaborative problem-solving.

### Quality Over Quantity
Curated, high-quality learning paths that genuinely prepare students for success—not thousands of random problems.

### Open Source
Built by students, for students. A FOSS project welcoming all contributors.
