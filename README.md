## 🌟 Philosophy

**Our mission is to cultivate a strong, collaborative coding culture.**

### First-Principles Thinking
We believe in understanding concepts from the ground up. Our learning tracks build intuition, not just pattern recognition.

### Community-Driven  
Learning DSA is hard, and it's better together. KodeBlocks features community events, leaderboards, and collaborative problem-solving.

### Quality Over Quantity
Curated, high-quality learning paths that genuinely prepare students for success—not thousands of random problems.

### Open Source
Built by students, for students. A FOSS project welcoming all contributors.

## 🏗️ Architecture

KodeBlocks follows **clean architecture principles** with a layered design:

- **Routes** - Thin routing layer (3-5 lines per file)
- **Features** - Page composition and UI logic
- **Components** - Reusable UI elements organized by feature
- **Services** - Business logic and data transformations
- **API** - Database queries and external API calls

**For detailed architecture documentation, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)**
